# Fetch-PreApproved-Queries-Data
When we want to get the data from production database and we don't have access to production data so we have to depend on DB person. So to avoid the dependency I have created this MVC application which has some pre-approved queries by DB person and we can get the production data directly without any approvals. 
DB person can add queries which will not affect the production database and developer can run those query and get the data.
